                                    <p>Users must note that all games available on the Lagibet platform are Games of Skills, under Indian law, and that Lagibet does not support, endorse or offer to Users games of chance for money or betting. While Games of Skill do not have a comprehensive definition, they are those games where success depends predominantly upon the superior knowledge, skill, training, attention, experience and adroitness of the player.</p>
                                    <p>The games hosted on the Lagibet platform have clearly defined rules and Users are encouraged to read, understand and follow these rules to be successful in these games.</p>
                                    <p>The games hosted on the Lagibet platform are Games of Skills, such that the outcome/success in the games is directly dependent on the Users effort, performance and skill. By choosing how to play, the actions of Users shall have direct impact on the game.</p>
                                    <p>Every game will have some elements of chance, but in the form of challenges/obstacles that a User would be able to overcome using his/her skills, experience and knowledge of the game. Elements of luck maybe present in some games to add thrill and excitement, but between a contest of two users where one is lucky but without knowledge, skill, training, experience and adroitness and the other is not so lucky but with knowledge, skill , experience, training and adroitness, the latter is certain to win in more than 90 out of 100 games.</p>
                                        Also no two attempts at a game are identical so Users must use their skills and abilities in order to be successful.</p>
                                    <p>Since the games available on the Lagibet platform can be won through Users skills and such skills may be enhanced with practice and experience, the performance of a User may improve with time and practice.</p>
                                    <p>Different games will reward different skills, but each game will reward certain skills, such as knowledge of the game, familiarity with rules, experience, reflexes, knowledge, logic,  practice, hand-eye coordination etc.</p>
                                    <p>Certain games may have pre-determined outcomes (Such as trivia quizzes) and these outcomes are achievable by Users using their skills.</p>
                                    <p>If any user has doubt that accessing Lagibet App may violate local laws or regulation, which prohibits online game for stake or money, then we strongly advice such users not to access our app, failing which, user shall by solely responsible for the consequences.</p>
